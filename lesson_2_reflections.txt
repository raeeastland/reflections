Reflect: Initializing a Repository
What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

When you init a repository Git creates metadata in a .git directory.  This is used to track subsequent changes in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area holds files from the working dir that may later be saved (commited) to the repository.  A staging area allows groups of files to be committed together and allows for the possibility to undo before a commit.
